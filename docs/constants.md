Constants
=========

### Host / Hardware
The host "machine" in this case is the web browser.  This is comprised of the JavaScript enviornment
and the HTML webpage that the [VM](/KayoticSully/KayoticOS/blob/master/docs/vm.md) interacts with.

### VM : Virtual Machine
The virtual machine is made up of the JavaScript Objects that emulate the host hardware such as the CPU.

### Client
The client is the rest of the JavaScript written to interface between the VM and the console to run
user programs and commands.
